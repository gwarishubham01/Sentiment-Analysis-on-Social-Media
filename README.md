The script's output will vary based on the specific Yelp restaurant page you choose to scrape and the reviews available on that page. As you can see in the above image, the output will include sentiment analysis results for each review, represented as numerical scores typically ranging from 1 to 5. These scores indicate the sentiment of each individual review. Therefore, the actual output you receive will depend on the content and sentiment of the reviews present on the selected Yelp page.
