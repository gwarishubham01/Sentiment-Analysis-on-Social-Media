<h2>Introduction:</h2>    

In today's digital age, social media platforms have become a treasure trove of opinions, emotions, and sentiments expressed by individuals across the globe. Understanding the sentiment behind social media posts is invaluable for businesses, researchers, and individuals seeking to gain insights into public opinion. This project, "Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data Using Deep Learning," aims to harness the power of deep learning techniques to automatically analyze and categorize sentiments expressed in social media content.
    
<h2>Project Overview:</h2>   

This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify social media data into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to determine the emotional tone or attitude expressed in text.
